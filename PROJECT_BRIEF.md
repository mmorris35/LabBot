# PROJECT_BRIEF.md

## Basic Information

- **Project Name**: LabBot
- **Project Type**: web_app
- **Primary Goal**: Help patients interpret their lab results in plain language
- **Target Users**: Patients with medical lab results, Caregivers reviewing results for family members, Health-conscious individuals tracking biomarkers
- **Timeline**: 1 week
- **Team Size**: 1

## Functional Requirements

### Key Features (MVP)

1. **Accept JSON lab results via web form or API endpoint**
   - POST `/api/interpret` accepts JSON payload
   - Web form with JSON textarea input
   - Validate JSON structure before processing

2. **PII detection gate - refuse AI analysis if personal identifiers detected**
   - Scan for names, SSNs, DOBs, addresses, phone numbers, emails
   - Block request with clear error if PII found
   - Client-side warning + server-side enforcement

3. **Plain-language explanations with citations for each lab value**
   - Claude Haiku generates patient-friendly explanations
   - Each explanation includes reference range context
   - Citations link to authoritative medical sources (Mayo Clinic, NIH, etc.)

4. **Flag abnormal values with severity indicators**
   - Visual indicators: normal (green), borderline (yellow), abnormal (red)
   - Severity levels: within range, slightly out of range, significantly abnormal
   - Recommendations for follow-up when appropriate

5. **Simple responsive web UI for input and results display**
   - Single-page interface
   - JSON input area with sample data button
   - Results displayed in readable card format
   - Mobile-friendly responsive design

### Nice-to-Have Features (v2)

- PDF export of interpreted results
- Support for common lab report formats (Quest, LabCorp)
- Comparison to previous results if user provides them
- Mobile-optimized UI

## Technical Constraints

### Must Use

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- Claude API (Haiku for cost efficiency)
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- SAM (Serverless Application Model)
- HTML/CSS/vanilla JS frontend
- pytest for testing

### Cannot Use

- Conda
- Heavy frontend frameworks (React/Vue/Angular)
- Databases (stateless design)

## Other Constraints

- Must autodeploy to AWS free tier serverless via GitHub Actions
- Zero PII sent to Claude API - strict client-side and server-side detection
- Response time under 10 seconds for typical lab panel
- No database required - stateless operation
- HIPAA-aware design (disclaimer, no data retention)
- Medical disclaimer required on all outputs

## Success Criteria

- All MVP features implemented and working
- Code passes linting (ruff) and type checking (mypy)
- Test coverage >= 80%
- Documentation complete
- Deploys successfully to AWS Lambda
- End-to-end test passes with sample lab data
