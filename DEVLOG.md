# LabBot Development Log

> This log captures the journey from idea to implementation, demonstrating structured AI-assisted development.

---

## Project Genesis

**Date**: 2025-12-19
**Methodology**: DevPlan (structured AI development planning)

### The Idea
LabBot helps patients interpret their lab results in plain language. A simple concept with real healthcare value - perfect for demonstrating how structured planning accelerates development.

### Planning Phase
- **PROJECT_BRIEF.md**: Captured requirements through guided interview
- **DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md**: Generated detailed implementation roadmap
- **CLAUDE.md**: Established coding standards and workflow rules

### Why This Approach?
Traditional development often jumps straight to code. This project demonstrates:
1. Requirements gathering before architecture
2. Phased implementation with clear milestones
3. Consistent quality through defined standards
4. Documentation as a first-class deliverable
